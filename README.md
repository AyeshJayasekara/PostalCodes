# PostalCodes
Sri Lankan postal codes in a SQLite file.
This was actually a byproduct of one of my projects in university. However I did a thorough search on internet to find one complete database. It was kind of difficult, most of them were not complete or does not fit to my project requirements. Therefore I went further and designed my own version of postal codes database.
